            <p>Designing for accessibility is no longer just a "nice-to-have" feature; it's a fundamental requirement for a modern, inclusive web. In this article, we'll explore the best practices for creating designs that everyone can use, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities.</p>
            <h2>1. Prioritize Keyboard Navigation</h2>
            <p>One of the most important aspects of accessibility is ensuring that your website can be navigated entirely using a keyboard. This is essential for users with motor impairments who cannot use a mouse. Ensure that all interactive elements have visible focus states and that the tab order is logical.</p>
            <h2>2. Use High-Contrast Colors</h2>
            <p>Color contrast is crucial for users with visual impairments. Use tools to check that your text color contrasts sufficiently with its background. Aim for at least WCAG AA standards.</p>
            <h2>3. Provide Alternative Text for Images</h2>
            <p>Screen readers use alt text to describe images to visually impaired users. Be descriptive but concise. If an image is purely decorative, use an empty alt attribute (alt="").</p>
            <p>By following these best practices, you can create a better experience for all users.</p>
